// Pairing between the in-memory config account list and the AccountManager's.
//
// The two lists are NOT positionally aligned. resolveAccounts drops every entry
// without a usable credential, so from the first drop onward a config index and
// a manager index name different accounts — permanently, for the life of the
// process. Indexing one list with the other's index writes one account's
// refreshed OAuth tokens onto another account's config record, and that record
// is what gets persisted to disk. On a fleet holding accounts that belong to
// different people, that is a credential crossing rather than a mix-up.
//
// Each entry carries an id unique within its list (see account-id.js), and
// makeAccount copies it onto the account built from the entry, so an account
// names the entry it came from. Pairing is that lookup, which is why it needs no
// evidence and admits no ambiguity: it survives the refresh that rewrites the
// credential, and it separates two entries that agree on everything else.

 * the next start. findUpsertTarget in identity.js puts the same questions in
 * this order for the login axis.
 *
 * Ids can disagree with disk — a file written before the field existed, or
 * re-minted by another process — which is why they cannot be the only pass.
 *
 * A row the operator removed is claimed by nobody. Removal consults `removedIds`
 * where rows are carried over, so the removed row is not appended as its own
 * entry; without the same check here, the identity fallback matched that row
 * to a surviving namesake and merged its fields in — including `importFrom`,
 * which names the file an entry reads its credential from at the next start, so
