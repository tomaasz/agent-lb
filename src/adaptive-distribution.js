// Adaptive session distribution (the third `distributeSessions` mode).
//
// The even mode spreads new sessions by active-session count alone, which
// treats every account as interchangeable. Two things make that wrong once a
// fleet is mixed:
//
//   - Accounts are on different plans. An even split sends a Pro account the
//     same share as a Max 20x, so the small one hits its weekly wall days
//     before the big one is half spent.
//   - Spreading evenly FRAGMENTS the weekly windows. Five accounts each left at
//     60% at reset is five windows' worth of credit thrown away, where four
//     spent accounts and one at 0% is the same work with the headroom kept
//     where it can still be used.
//
// So this mode does the opposite of even: it concentrates new sessions on the
// account with the LEAST remaining weekly credit, to finish that window off —
// but tapers its share away as it approaches the switch threshold, so it is
// spent down to the wall and never into it, and backs off when the account is
// congested, so concentrating never costs response time.
//
// Plan size comes from the authoritative OAuth profile tier. The two dynamic
// quantities — burn rate and tolerated concurrency — are learned from traffic,
// so the fleet responds to current behavior without guessing the subscription.
