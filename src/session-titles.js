/**
 * Session titles for the activity log.
 *
 * The proxy already knows which Claude Code session a request belongs to: the
 * client sends `x-claude-code-session-id`, and the TUI prints its first six hex
 * characters. That distinguishes concurrent sessions but does not name them.
 *
 * Claude Code stores the name on disk under `~/.claude/projects/<slug>/`. A
 * `/rename` writes `<session-id>/custom-title.json`; it also appends a
 * `custom-title` record to the transcript, which is the only copy for a session
 * renamed before the sidecar existed. Claude Code generates its own title as
 * well and appends it as an `ai-title` record, so most sessions have a usable
 * name without a rename.
 *
 * Lookups are cached and run off the render path: `get` returns what is cached
 * and schedules the read, so a frame never waits on the disk.
