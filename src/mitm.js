// MITM forward-proxy support: local cert lifecycle + terminating CONNECT proxy.
//
// When a claude instance is launched with HTTPS_PROXY pointed at teamclaude it
// sends `CONNECT api.anthropic.com:443`. Rather than byte-relaying the tunnel, we
// TERMINATE it with a real Node HTTP/2 server (allowHTTP1, so an h1 client works
// too) presenting our locally-minted leaf, then forward each request with a
// buffering, retrying client — the SAME path the base proxy uses
// (createProxyRequestListener). That gives per-request account selection, body
// account_uuid rewriting, and — critically — the ability to resend a request on a
// different account when one returns a quota 429, instead of surfacing it. A host
// routing table decides per-CONNECT behavior:
//   api.anthropic.com → terminate + forward,  www.example.org → local test server,
//   anything else      → blind tunnel (never to this machine — see forward-target.js).
