// A session pins PER WEEKLY QUOTA BUCKET, not once overall. Quota and
// eligibility are already decided per bucket — an account whose Fable weekly is
// spent still serves Opus perfectly well — so a single pin per session lets a
// decision taken for one family relocate the whole session:
// a Fable request diverted off the pinned account re-pins the session there,

// for Opus and whose Opus cache is cold. Keying each pin by the weekly bucket
// that governs the request keeps the families' affinities independent.
//

//   - KNOWN: a session is remembered until it goes idle for this long, then
//     forgotten. 1h matches the maximum prompt-cache extension window — past
//     that there is no cache left to preserve, so the pin has no value.
//   - ACTIVE: a session counts as "active" (and toward per-account load) if it
//     made a request this recently. Short, so load-balancing reacts to what is
//     actually running now rather than to sessions merely lingering in the hour.
