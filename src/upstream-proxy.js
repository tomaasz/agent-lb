// Outbound (egress) proxy for everything teamclaude sends to Anthropic.
//
// Distinct from two other things that also say "proxy" in this codebase:
//   - `config.proxy` is the LOCAL server Claude Code talks to (inbound).
//   - `config.sx` is the sx.org residential-egress integration, a specific
//     paid provider with its own provisioning API and its own routing policy
//     (always / on-429 / off).
// This one is the plain corporate case: the machine cannot open a socket to
// api.anthropic.com at all, and every outbound connection has to go through an
// HTTP CONNECT proxy (issue #155). It is not a routing policy — when set, it is
// simply how this host reaches the internet.
//
// Node's global fetch cannot use a CONNECT proxy without undici, and "zero
// dependencies" is a project feature, so the tunnel is built by hand on top of
// the same connectThroughProxy() the sx path uses.
//
// Precedence: an explicit request to route via sx wins (sx IS an egress proxy;
// chaining one through the other would be two hops to solve one problem). With
// sx off or not selected for this attempt, the upstream proxy applies.
